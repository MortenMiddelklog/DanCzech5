                    <h2>Welcome to DanCzech</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello 🤗. Welcome to my website. My name is Heidi Westergaard Poulsen and I live on the Island Funen in the mittle of Denmark 🇩🇰. I have had cesky terriers since 2002.
                        Was usually breeder of English Springer Spaniels and American Cocker Spaniels, but once I saw a cesky, I decided this must be my next breed.<br><br>

                        Palmis Viktoria von Klanovice (Cici) was my first cesky puppy. She was the most fun and loving little girl with the best temper. Sadly never succeded getting puppies from Cici. Cici died age 14 years.<br><br>

                        Barley Pibaro was the second cesky, he was such a clever and funny guy, one you can only love 💙. With him I decided to follow these lines and have done that all the way 🤗. Sadly Barley died on his 12th birthday 💔 <br><br>

                        Galina of Cesky Dream's was my Winner bitch, one of a kind. Sadly she didn't get any puppies either. Died in age 14,5 years.<br><br>

                        Lenicka Of Cesky Dream's was such a sweetheart. She was the biggest cuddler. She was not into shows, but was a perfect agility dog. She was my first cesky getting puppies. American Joy Amirál was born december 2015 💙. Lenicka had cancer and died age 10.5 years.<br><br>

                        Stardust Cartier (Cerny) came to our house after being rehomed in age 4 months. We loved him from first moment. He is a funny, happy and handsome guy. Cerny is a dog that loves to work. Agility, hoopers, nosework, tracking, he does everything and is very good at it. Cerny is proud father of 3 litters.<br><br>

                        Brusinka Kvitko is that one of a kind cesky, for me the perfect cesky. Sometimes a bit strange, but mostly loving and fun. She is a hunting dog, loves using her nose. Brusinka and Cerny blessed me with 2 beautiful litters.<br><br>

                        DanCzech Cinie is the daughter of Brusinka and Cerny. Cinie is a sweet, loving, funny and beautiful little girl. Everyones favorit ❤️
                        A judge told me, "she is the perfect result of what I imagine a cross between the Scottie and Sealyham would look like". Cinie loves to climb, jump and work with her nose.
